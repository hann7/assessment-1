# Assumptions & Notes:

- server side data validation is in place, all input is good to go
- registration expiration should be updated on the front end to be the same as the db format (YYYY-MM-DD), but if not we can easily manipulate that
- data is all in one table for the sake of time but I've included a diagram of one possible way the database can be organized for scaling purposes

## How to start server:

- npm install
- npm run dev
